Session 13 - Homework 12

The difference between IDs, Classes, and Tags are:
Each element can have only one ID, and the ID cannot be shared with other elements on each page.
However, Classes can be used on multiple elements, and multiple classes can be used on the same element.
Tag, however, is used differently compared to ID or Class. 
Tag creates something like label on element to specifies what each element is. 
IDs and Classes are inside of Tags.

'Specificity' play an important role in the selection of HTML elements in a way that 
If there are two or more conflicting CSS codes that point to the same element, 
the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins out.
If there is element that points out h1 {color: red} and h1 {color: green}, 
the latter will be excuted and applied as a style, and therefore, h1 {color: green} will be applied.

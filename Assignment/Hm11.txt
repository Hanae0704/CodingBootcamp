Session 12 - Homework 11

What is considered the right size for an image or video asset?

The right size for an image varies depends on when to use the image for. 
For printing, images need to be 300px or more resolution to get a good quality. 
For web uses, 72px resolution is okay, and increasing resolution size increases file size, so this has to be careful.

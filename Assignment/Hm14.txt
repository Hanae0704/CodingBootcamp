Session 15 - Homework 14

- What is a CSS Preprocessor?

Preprocessor is a computer program that changes data to 
conform with the input requirements of another program.
So, CSS Preprocessor is also a computer program which generates and extends 
regluar CSS into CSS syntax by using some application.

- What are some examples?
I found that Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is one of the most popular CSS Preprocessor.

- In React, what are styled components?
In React, styled components are where to style the designs using CSS.

- How do Styled Components violate separation of concerns?
I am not sure if Styled Components violate separation of concerns 
because Styled Component is to style the design created by HTML or JS, and it is where uses CSS. 
I believe Styled Component is separating CSS from HTML and JS and making things clear.

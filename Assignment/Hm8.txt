Session 9 - Homework 8

What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and SVG images?

JPG:
JPEG is used for photographs, that is loosy raster files. 
Reduction of file size affects the image quality.

GIF:
GIF is used for motion/animated image, and not good use for photographs.

PNG:
PNG is best use for web and works well with line art images. 
Unlike JPG, PNG file can be exported with a transparent background.

SVG:
As SVG is shorten for "scaleable Vector Graphic", 
SVG is vector graphic image which is great for logo and line art. 
Because SVG is not made from pixels, it can be resized without the loss of quality.

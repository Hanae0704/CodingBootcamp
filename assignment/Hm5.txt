Session 6 - Homework 5


Both a relative path and an absolute path describe 
the location of a file or folder, but have major differences. 
Relative paths contain information which is only related to 
the current working document within the same website, 
so information is limited. 
However, unlike relative paths, absolute paths contain 
information that can be found from anywhere 
regardless of the current working document/directory.

Session 3 - Homework 2

Separation of Concerns is a design principle which separates a computer program to separate sections. 
In relationship to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for example, designing and styling can be done by HTML and programming by JS.

HTML to create contents, CSS to style, and JS to program can separate sections that each section addresses a separate concern.
